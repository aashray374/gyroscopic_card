  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: GyroscopicCard(
            sensitivity: 0.05,
            maxAngleRadians: 0.785, // 45 degrees in radians
            child: Container(
              width: 250,
              height: 350,
              alignment: Alignment.center,

              ),
            ),
            cardProperties: Card(
              elevation: 8,
              shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16),
              ),
